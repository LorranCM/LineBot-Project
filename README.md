# LineBot-Project

This project was developed as part of SENAI's Logical Reasoning curriculum, aiming to apply 
programming logic concepts and stimulate structured thinking through an interactive game.

ABOUT THE GAME :

The game involves an explorer robot that must navigate different mazes until it reaches the end 
point. To do so, the player must provide instructions to the robot in the form of logical commands 
(such as advance, turn, activate, etc.).

In each phase, the robot must not only find the exit but also activate actuators scattered along 
the way, which adds additional planning and action sequence challenges.

HOW THE GAME CONTRIBUTES TO LOGICAL REASONING

This game was designed as a teaching tool to stimulate logical and computational reasoning because:

It encourages the player to break down complex problems into smaller steps, developing sequences of 
instructions.

It requires anticipating consequences (if the robot turns left now, where will it be in the next 
step?).

It promotes the application of algorithmic concepts and conditional structures, even without the 
direct use of code.

It develops strategic thinking and the organization of ideas, essential for both programming and 
everyday problem-solving.

ACADEMIC OBJECTIVE

More than just a game, the project serves as a practical experience in applied logic, helping 
students visualize how logical reasoning is used to structure solutions.

--------- // ---------

To play the game, you need:
- Python 3.11.7
- Pygame library
